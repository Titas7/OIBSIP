                <h3>Early life</h3>
                <p>Born in Delhi on 23 August 1968 to Malayali parents,
                    Krishnakumar Kunnath grew up in New Delhi.
                     He sang
                    3,500 jingles before breaking into Bollywood.
                    
                    KK attended Delhi's Mount St Mary's School,
                     and Kirori
                    Mal College,
                     Delhi University. He appeared in the song
                    "Josh of India", released to support the Indian national team
                    during the 1999 Cricket World Cup.
                    
                    KK married Jyothy in 1991. His son, Nakul Krishna
                    Kunnath, sang "Masti" (from his album, Humsafar) with

                <h3>Career</h3>
                <p>After receiving a degree in commerce from Kirori Mal College, KK spent six months as a marketing
                    executive before pursuing his love of music. He struggled to establish himself in the competitive
                    recording industry, singing at hotels to make ends meet. KK moved to Mumbai in 1994.He had no formal musical training.According to film director Mahesh Bhatt, "KK had an
                    emotional bandwidth which echoed all the seasons of the heart. He could be frivolous, romantic
                    and anguished. He could go into the depths, talk about the wonder and magic of life."
                    KK believed that it was unimportant for a singer's face to be seen, but "a singer must be heard".
                    In a 2019 interview, he said that he felt comfortable with a microphone but awkward in front of a
                    camera. KK valued and "fiercely" protected his privacy. He did not want his singing to be
                    associated with a particular actor and preferred singing for a number of actors.</p>

                    Mumbai.

                <h3>Death</h3>
                <p>On 31 May 2022, KK performed a concert at a college festival at Nazrul Mancha in South
                    Kolkata.
                    After the concert, he returned to his hotel in Esplanade. KK complained of feeling
                    unwell on the way back to his hotel, where he experienced cardiac arrest. He collapsed, and efforts
                    to revive him at the hotel were unsuccessful. KK was rushed to Calcutta Medical Research
                    Institute (CMRI) at about 10:30 pm, where he was declared dead. He was 53 years old.
                    On 1 June 2022, Kolkata Police registered a case of unnatural death to investigate KK's
                    death.His autopsy was videographed; the report cited myocardial infarction (heart attack)
                    as the probable cause of death, ruling out foul play. According to the doctor who conducted the
                    autopsy, KK could have survived if he had received cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR)
                    immediately after losing consciousness. He had complained to his wife about pain in his
                    shoulder and arm for several days before his death, thinking it was caused by digestive problems.
                    According to the autopsy report, KK's heart had an 80-percent blockage.
                    Three public interest
                    litigations (PILs) related to the singer's death were registered in the Calcutta High Court.</p>
